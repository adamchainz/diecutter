*********************
Why "diecutter" name?
*********************

A "die cutter" is a machine that cuts materials to produce shapes, from molds.

Here, the diecutter web service produces files from data and templates.


*****************************************************
Does it replaces my web framework (Django) templates?
*****************************************************

**diecutter is not meant to replace web framework's template engines!**
Diecutter is meant to replace file generators for configuration or scaffolding
use cases.

Even if processes are really close, environment and needs aren't.
As an example, diecutter service won't be as efficient as web frameworks
internal templating systems.

So, even if, in theory, you could use diecutter as a template engine to render
pages of a website, it is discouraged.
