**********
Python API
**********

`diecutter` is written in `Python`_. Here are some tips about `diecutter`'s
internals:

* `diecutter` is built on top of a third-party project called `piecutter`_.
  `piecutter` provides things such as template engines and template loaders.
  In most cases, i.e. except you explicitely need `diecutter`'s WSGI layer,
  have a look at `piecutter`'s Python API.

* `diecutter` provides a WSGI layer and a REST API on top of `piecutter`.

.. note::

   At the moment, authors put efforts in `piecutter`'s API, because it is more
   general purpose than `diecutter`'s. That said, if you have an use case for
   `diecutter` API, `let us know
   <https://github.com/diecutter/diecutter/issues>`_! Feedback, reviews and
   contributions are welcome ;)
