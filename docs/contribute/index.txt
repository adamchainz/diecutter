Contributor guide
#################

This document provides guidelines for people who want to contribute to the
project.


**************
Create tickets
**************

Please use the `bugtracker`_ **before** starting some work:

* check if the bug or feature request has already been filed. It may have been
  answered too!

* else create a new ticket.

* if you plan to contribute, tell us, so that we are given an opportunity to
  give feedback as soon as possible.

* Then, in your commit messages, reference the ticket with some
  ``refs #TICKET-ID`` syntax.


***************
Fork and branch
***************

Work in forks and branches.

* Prefix your branch with the ticket ID corresponding to the issue. As an
  example, if you are working on ticket #23 which is about contribute
  documentation, name your branch like ``23-contribute-doc``.

* If you work in a development branch and want to refresh it with changes from
  master, please `rebase`_ or `merge-based rebase`_, i.e. don't merge master.


*******************************
Setup a development environment
*******************************

System requirements:

* `Virtualenv`_ for `Python`_ version 2.7, available as ``virtualenv`` command.
* make and wget to use the provided :file:`Makefile`.

Execute:

.. code:: sh

   git clone git@github.com:novagile/diecutter.git
   cd diecutter/
   make develop

If you cannot execute the :file:`Makefile`, read it and adapt the few commands
it contains to your needs.


************
The Makefile
************

A :file:`Makefile` is provided to ease development.

Use it to run common development tasks, such as:

* setup the development environment: ``make develop`` ;
* run tests: ``make test`` ;
* build documentation: ``make documentation`` ;
* run demo server on port 8106: ``make serve``...

The :file:`Makefile` is intended to be a live reference for the development
environment.


*********************
Demo project included
*********************

The :doc:`/demo` is part of the project. Maintain it along with code and
documentation.
