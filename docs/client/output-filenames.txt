Variable-based output filenames
###############################

When rendering a directory, it is sometimes useful to use variables in the
filenames to output.

.. note::

   This is useless for single files, since most clients allow you to choose the
   name of the output file.

Setup templates with ``+variable+`` in the filename:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo "Focus on filename" | curl -X PUT -F "file=@-" http://localhost:8106/foo/+bar+.txt
 
The variables within ``+`` will be resolved and replaced by their value:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl -X POST -d bar=baz http://localhost:8106/foo | tar -zt
   foo/baz.txt

.. note::

   This behaviour is disabled when using the :doc:`template tree template
   <dynamic-trees>`.

**This feature is meant for simple cases**. If you need advanced things for
filenames, use the :doc:`template tree template <dynamic-trees>`.
