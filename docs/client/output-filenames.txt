Variable-based output filenames
###############################

This document explains how to render dynamic filenames.

When rendering a directory, it is sometimes useful to use variables in the
filenames to output.

.. tip::

   This is useless for single files, since most clients allow you to choose the
   name of the output file.

.. include:: /doctests.inc

.. testsetup::

   from StringIO import StringIO
   import tarfile

When rendering directories, templates having ``+variable+`` in the filename
will be resolved against the context data:  

.. doctest::
 
   >>> url = diecutter_url + 'simple-tree/'
   >>> response = requests.get(url)
   >>> print response.content
   +name+.txt
   >>> response = requests.post(url, {'name': 'demo'})
   >>> archive = tarfile.open(fileobj=StringIO(response.content))
   >>> print archive.getnames()
   ['demo.txt']

.. tip::

   **The "variable-based filenames" feature is meant for simple cases**. If you
   need advanced things for filenames, use the :doc:`dynamic trees feature
   <dynamic-trees>`.

   Notice that "variable-based filenames" behaviour is disabled when using the
   dynamic trees.
