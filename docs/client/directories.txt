Directories
###########

Directories are the second type of template resource. They are collections of
files and directories resources.

Here is service's API overview:

* `PUT`_: directories are automatically created when you PUT a file in it.
  There is currently no way to create a whole directory with one request
  (uploading an archive as an example).

* `GET`_: list files in directory.
* `POST`_: render templates in directory against context, as an archive.
* other HTTP verbs aren't implemented yet.

.. note::

   In the examples below, we'll consider that a diecutter service is running
   at http://localhost:8106.


***
PUT
***

Let's create some "greetings" directory with "hello.txt" and "goodbye.txt"
inside:
    
.. code-block:: text

   $ echo "Hello {{ name }}!" | curl -X PUT  -F "file=@-" http://localhost:8106/greetings/hello.txt
   {"diecutter": "Ok"}

   $ echo "Good bye {{ name }}!" | curl -X PUT  -F "file=@-" http://localhost:8106/greetings/goodbye.txt
   {"diecutter": "Ok"}


***
GET
***

GET lists files in directory:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl http://localhost:8106/greetings/
   hello.txt
   goodbye.txt 

Notice that, if you don't set the trailing slash, you get the same list with
folder name as prefix:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl http://localhost:8106/greetings
   greetings/hello.txt
   greetings/goodbye.txt 


****
POST
****

POST renders directory against a context:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl -X POST -d name="world" -s http://localhost:8106/greetings | tar -zx

   $ tree greetings
   greetings
   ├── hello.txt
   └── goodbye.txt
   0 directory, 2 files

   $ cat greetings/hello.txt
   Hello world!

   $ cat greetings/goodbye.txt
   Goodbye world!

All files in directory are rendered with the same context data.

Like with `GET`_, the trailing slash affects filenames: without trailing slash,
filenames are prefixed with directory name.

Supported archives types: "accept" header
=========================================

By default, POST requests return GZIP archives.

You can get the content as a TAR.GZ archive with the "accept" header:

.. code:: text

   $ curl -X POST --header "accept:application/zip" -d name="world" http://localhost:8106/greetings > greetings.zip
   $ unzip greetings.zip
   $ tree greetings
   greetings
   ├── hello.txt
   └── goodbye.txt
   0 directory, 2 files

.. tip::

   You can see all supported "accept" headers by requesting an unknown mime
   type:

   .. code:: text

      $ curl -X POST --header "accept:fake/mime-type" -d name="world" http://localhost:8106/greetings
      406 Not Acceptable

      The server could not comply with the request since it is either malformed or
      otherwise incorrect.


      Supported mime types: */*, application/gzip, application/x-gzip,
      application/zip
