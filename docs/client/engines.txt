Targeting template engines
##########################

`diecutter` supports several template engines. This section explains how
`diecutter` chooses the engine for a given template.

As a summary, `diecutter` follows the scenario below:

* ``engine`` `in query string`_;
* `default engine`_.

Notice that `diecutter` sets a `diecutter-engine header in responses`_.

.. testsetup::
   :hide:

   import requests
   import diecutter.tests

   diecutter_url = diecutter_server.application_url

   # Serve demo project.
   diecutter_server = diecutter.tests.demo_server()

.. testcleanup::
   :hide:

   diecutter_server.shutdown()


***************
In query string
***************

If the HTTP request has a known ``engine`` in query string, then `diecutter`
uses it to render the template. Here is an example using ``jinja2``:

.. doctest::

   >>> greetings_url = diecutter_url + 'greetings.txt?engine=jinja2'
   >>> response = requests.get(greetings_url)
   >>> print response.headers['Diecutter-Engine']
   jinja2

Here is an example using ``django``:

.. doctest::

   >>> greetings_url = diecutter_url + 'greetings.txt?engine=django'
   >>> response = requests.get(greetings_url)
   >>> print response.headers['Diecutter-Engine']
   django


**************
Default engine
**************

In case no specific engine was resolved for the current request, `diecutter`
fallbacks to default engines. Default engines are setup in configuration:

* ``diecutter.engine`` is the default engine used to render files;
* ``diecutter.filename_engine`` is the default engine used to render filenames.

The configuration itself defaults to ``jinja2``.

.. doctest::

   >>> greetings_url = diecutter_url + 'greetings.txt'
   >>> response = requests.get(greetings_url)
   >>> print response.headers['Diecutter-Engine']
   jinja2


************************************
diecutter-engine header in responses
************************************

`diecutter` sets the value of used engine as ``Diecutter-Engine`` header.
