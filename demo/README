Let's try diecutter!


***********
Online SAAS
***********

There is an online server hosting `diecutter`:

* index page: http://diecutter.io/
* demo templates API: http://diecutter.io/api/
* API using Github loader: http://diecutter.io/github/

In most cases, http://diecutter.io/ and :doc:`/client/index` reference should
be enough for you to discover `diecutter`.


*************
In sourcecode
*************

The :file:`demo/` directory in `diecutter's sourcecode`_ contains templates in
:file:`templates/` folder. They are basically used for documentation
(doctests).

Feel free to use it as a sandbox.


*****************
Local demo server
*****************

Here are instructions to run `diecutter`'s demo on your machine.

System requirements:

* `Python`_ version 2.7, available as ``python`` command.

  .. note::

     You may use `Virtualenv`_ to make sure the active ``python`` is the right
     one.

* make and wget to use the provided :file:`Makefile`.

Execute:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone git@github.com:diecutter/diecutter.git
   cd diecutter/
   make develop
   make serve

The last command runs diecutter service on localhost, port 8106.
Check it at http://localhost:8106/

.. tip::

   If you cannot execute the :file:`Makefile`, read it and adapt the few
   commands it contains to your needs.
